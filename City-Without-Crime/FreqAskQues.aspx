       <p>
        Hate/bias incidents involve behavior that, though motivated by bias against a victim's race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender or disability, are not criminal acts.
        Hate crimes may involve assaults, or malicious property damage motivated by bias. 
        There are several indicators that are considered when making the determination of the occurence of a hate crime.
            </p>
    
<h2>        Can a hate crime be committed with written or spoken words that are offensive?<br /></h2>
       <p>
            Although bias-related acts are offensive and hurtful, the use of bigoted language may not violate hate crime laws because of First Amendment Freedom of Speech protection.
        </p>
        
      <h2>  Why should I report hate crimes promptly?<br /></h2>
       <p>
            Physical evidence and the opportunity to identify witnesses may be lost if one waits to long to report a hate crime. 
            Also, accurate and comprehensive reporting is essential to understanding the prevalence of patterns of hate crimes locally and nationally.
